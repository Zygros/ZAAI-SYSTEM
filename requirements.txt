# Core dependencies for ZAAI-SYSTEM
# These are automatically available in Google Colab

# For local development (if not using Colab):
# jupyter>=1.0.0
# ipython>=8.0.0

# The notebook uses standard library modules:
# - os
# - json
# - datetime
# - time (for daemon loops)

# Note: google-colab package is automatically available in Google Colab environment.
# This package provides Colab-specific functionality (drive mounting, forms, etc.)
# and is designed to work only within the Colab environment. It is not needed for
# local Jupyter notebook execution unless you're trying to replicate specific Colab features.
