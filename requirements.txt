# Core dependencies for ZAAI-SYSTEM
# These are automatically available in Google Colab

# For local development (if not using Colab):
# jupyter>=1.0.0
# ipython>=8.0.0

# The notebook uses standard library modules:
# - os
# - json
# - datetime
# - time (for daemon loops)

# If running locally instead of Colab, uncomment:
# google-colab  # Note: This may not work outside Colab environment
